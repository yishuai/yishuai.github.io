<h1>THE TASK OF THE REFEREE </h1>

<h5 align="left">Computer researchers have a professional obligation to referee 
the work of others. This article tells you how to evaluate a paper and write a 
report using common standards and procedures.</h5>
<p><font size="+4">T</font> here is an endless stream of research papers submitted 
to conferences, journals, newsletters, anthologies, annuals, trade journals, 
newspapers, and other periodicals. Many such publications use impartial, 
external experts to evaluate papers. This approach is often called peer review, 
and the reviewers are called referees. Refereeing is a public service, one of 
the professional obligations of a computer science and engineering professional. 
Unfortunately, referees typically learn to produce referee reports without any 
formal instruction; they learn by practice, by feedback from editors, by seeing 
referee reports for their own papers, and by reading referee reports written by 
others. </p>
<p>This article tells you how to evaluate a paper, write a referee report, and 
apply common standards and procedures. It is intended to replace Forscher's 
rules(1), which are distributed by some editors but do not reflect the 
procedures used in computer science and engineering. This article focuses on 
research papers in applied areas of computer science and engineering, such as 
systems, architecture, hardware, communications, and performance evaluation, but 
most of the discussion is generally applicable; separate sections consider 
research proposals and survey and tutorial papers. Authors might find this 
material useful for preparing papers for publication. Another recent paper 
discusses refereeing in theoretical computer sciences; there are some 
differences between theory and the applied areas considered here. </p>
<h2>The referee's task </h2>
<p>Your role as referee is to decide whether a paper makes a sufficient 
contribution to the field. The contribution can be new and interesting research 
results, a new and insightful synthesis of existing results, a useful survey of 
or tutorial on a field, or a combination of those types. To quote a referee for 
this article: </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Small results which are surprising and might spark new 
    research should be published; papers which are mostly repetitions of other 
    papers should not; papers which have good ideas badly expressed should not 
    be published but the authors should be encouraged to rewrite them in a 
    better, more comprehensible fashion.</font></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Reading a paper as a referee is closer to what a teacher or professor does 
when grading a paper than what a scientist or engineer does when reading a 
published work. In the latter case, the reader presumes that the paper has been 
checked (refereed) and is thus correct, novel, and worthwhile. As a referee, on 
the other hand, you must read the paper carefully and with an open mind, 
checking and evaluating the material with no presumption as to its quality or 
accuracy. The result of your reading should be a referee report that recommends 
for or against accepting the paper and lists necessary and suggested changes. 
</p>
<p>It is important that you walk the uncertain line between being too permissive 
("publish everything") and being too restrictive ("nothing is good enough to 
publish"). If you are not critical enough, you encourage poor research, 
recognize and honor those who don't deserve it, mislead naive and inexperienced 
readers, mislead the author as to what is publishable, encourage disrespect for 
the field, distort commercial development, hiring, promotion, and tenure 
decisions, and perhaps actually subtract from the general store of knowledge; 
consider the Piltdown man fraud, which misled anthropologists for years. As has 
been noted by Thompson(3) and others, unrestrained publication buries the 
professional under mounds of paper, only a very small fraction of which can be 
examined, let alone read. </p>
<p>If you are too critical, you block or delay good research from publication, 
waste the time of authors, damage careers, and perhaps leave journals with 
nothing to publish and conferences with nothing to present. It is particularly 
important not to reject new and significant work that runs counter to the 
prevailing wisdom or current fashion. </p>
<p>If you want to be taken seriously as a referee, you must have a 
middle-of-the-road view--you must be able to distinguish good from bad work, 
major from minor research, and positive from negative contributions to the 
literature. A referee who always says "yes" or always says "no" is not helpful. 
</p>
<h2>The referee report </h2>
<p>A good referee report should have several parts. First, you should briefly 
state your recommendation and the reasons for it. Second, you should summarize 
the point of the paper in one to five sentences, both for the editor's use and 
to ensure that you actually understand the paper. Third, you should evaluate the 
validity and significance of the research goal. Fourth, you should evaluate the 
quality of the work (methodology, techniques, accuracy, and presentation). 
Finally, you must provide an overall recommendation for or against publication. 
If you recommend against publication, you should clearly state why. You should 
also make the strength of your opinions clear; an equivocal ("maybe") 
recommendation is acceptable if your reasons for it are clearly documented. In 
any case, your report must contain enough discussion and information to justify 
your recommendation.</p>

      <h4 align="center">How to become a referee </h4>
      <p align="center">Editors are always looking for qualified and responsible 
      referees. The easiest way to become a referee is to write a paper, thus 
      bringing your name and expertise to the attention of the community. You 
      can also become active in professional activities, such as local IEEE or 
      ACM groups, IEEE Technical Committees, ACM Special Interest groups, and 
      conferenceorganizing committees. Participating in these activities will 
      help you meet editors and program chairs. Also, editors sometimes actively 
      solicit referees </p></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
<p>If your recommendation is favorable, you must list both necessary and 
suggested changes. If your recommendation is negative, but you think the paper 
can be salvaged and either submitted elsewhere or resubmitted, then you should 
provide a similar (but perhaps less detailed) list. Suggestions for alternate 
places to publish are always welcome. </p>
<p>Refereeing a paper can require considerable time and effort; don't waste that 
effort on a detailed critique of a badly flawed paper that can never be made 
publishable. Finding one or more fatal and uncorrectable flaws excuses the 
referee from checking all subsequent details. </p>
<p>Typically, the author receives the text of the referee report stripped of all 
material identifying the referee. Thus, while it is important to be clear and 
explicit, your report should not be insulting. Don't refer to the author as a 
"fool" or an "idiot" nor to the paper as "trash." Your review should be directed 
at the paper, not the author. The review of a proposal, though, is also a review 
of the investigator. In this case, it is appropriate to evaluate the author's 
abilities as well as the research proposed. In all cases, however, the 
evaluation should be objective and fair. The more psychologically acceptable the 
review, the more useful it will be. </p>
<h2>Evaluating a research paper </h2>
<p>As a referee, you must evaluate a paper's novelty, significance, correctness, 
and readability. This general set of goals can be broken down into a much more 
specific series of questions. </p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of the paper?</b> What is the problem? Is it clearly 
stated? Does the author make the important issues clear? Does the author tell 
you early in the paper what he or she has accomplished? For example, if the 
paper is a system description, has the system been implemented or is it just a 
design? </p>
<p><b>Is the paper appropriate?</b> Does this paper have anything to do with 
computer science or engineering? If so, is the research appropriate for this 
forum? (Authors should not submit papers on queueing theory to <i>Datamation</i> 
or market analyses of the latest MVS release to the <i>Journal of the ACM</i> or 
the <i>Proceedings of the IEEE</i>.) </p>
<p><b>Is the goal significant?</b> For that matter, is the problem real? Does it 
contradict any physical laws (as do perpetual motion machines) or widely 
reported measurements? </p>
<p>Is there any reason to care about the paper's results, assuming they are 
correct? In other words, is the problem or goal major, minor, trivial, or 
nonexistent? Keep in mind what the Walrus said(4):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'The time has come,' </p>
  <p>the Walrus said, </p>
  <p>'To talk of many things; </p>
  <p>Of shoes-and ships-and sealing wax- </p>
  <p>Of cabbages-and kings- </p>
  <p>And why the sea is boiling hot- </p>
  <p>And whether pigs have wings.' </p></blockquote>
<p>Is this a careful analysis of how the sea became boiling hot or an elegant 
study of the flight characteristics of pigs? Sophisticated mathematical analyses 
can be applied to models so unrealistic that the effort is useless and the 
results of no interest. </p>
<p>Is the problem obsolete, such as a reliability study for vacuum tube 
mainframe computers? Is the problem so specific or so applied that it has no 
general applicability and does not merit wide publication? </p>
<p>Is the problem, goal, or intended result new? Has the design been built 
before? Has the problem been solved before? Is this a trivial variation on or 
extension of previous results? Is the author aware of related and previous work, 
both recent and old? Does he or she cite that work and give specific 
distinctions between it and the current work? If the paper describes an 
implementation, are there any new ideas?</p>
<p><b>Is the method of approach valid?</b> Is there something about the approach 
that invalidates the results? Can you tell what the method is, or do you have to 
ferret it out from mathematical formulas? What are the assumptions? How 
realistic are they? If they aren't realistic, does it matter? How sensitive are 
the results to the assumptions? </p>
<p>Is the approach sufficient for the purpose? For example, does it matter if 
the author overlooked available data and used a random-number-driven simulation 
with unrealistic parameters? "Back of the envelope" calculations are often 
sufficient. </p>
<p>If this is a new idea, does the author present enough discussion or analysis? 
There should be neither too much nor too little. Published archival papers are 
traditionally terse and complete but not cryptic; extensive and detailed 
discussions, along with voluminous supporting data, are better published as 
technical reports.</p>
<p><b>Is the actual execution of the research correct?</b> Are the mathematics 
correct? One or more referees should check the math in detail; you should always 
tell the editor if you didn't read or check some part of the paper. Are the 
proofs convincing? Are the statistics correct? Is the simulation methodology 
described in sufficient detail to convince you that the results are valid? For 
stochastic simulations, does the author give confidence intervals for the 
results? Are the results consistent with the assumptions or with observed facts 
or measurements? Have boundary conditions been checked? Are the results 
plausible or even possible? Did the author do what he or she claims? For 
example, did the author simulate the original system, a reasonable model of it, 
or just the approximate mathematical model?</p>
<p><b>Are the correct conclusions drawn from the results?</b> What are the 
applications or implications of the results? Does the author adequately discuss 
why he or she obtained these results?</p>
<p><b>Is the presentation satisfactory?</b> Is the paper written well enough for 
you to evaluate the technical content? A paper that is incomprehensible is not 
publishable. A paper that requires extensive revision is not publishable in its 
present form and might never be. If the paper is readable at all, you must 
evaluate the presentation as well as the technical content. (Refer to articles 
such as that by Day(5) to learn how to write a paper.) </p>
<p>Does the abstract describe the paper? Does the introduction adequately 
explain the problem and the research framework? Are the remaining sections 
clear, and do they follow in a logical order? Is there too much or too little 
detail? Are the grammar and syntax correct? Are the figures and tables well 
labeled, legible, and meaningful? Are there too many or too few tables and 
figures? Are explanations poor or even nonsensical? Is the author too verbose or 
too terse and cryptic? Is the paper sufficiently self-contained that someone 
knowledgeable in the field can understand it, or does the reader need detailed 
knowledge of results published elsewhere? If the author refers the reader to 
other papers for crucial details, do you believe him or her? </p>
<p>If sections of the paper are missing or incomplete due to a deadline, do you 
believe they will be filled in as promised? Is the paper too colloquial or too 
formal in style? Is the formalism useful or necessary? Are there many 
typographical errors? Is the paper too long? If so, does it contain too much 
material, or has the author been too wordy? Could the paper be split into two or 
more papers without losing coherence? The paper should be long enough to present 
the necessary material and no longer. Within reason, let the editor or program 
committee chair worry about specific page limits. </p>
<p>Does the paper contain typographical errors or problems in grammar, 
punctuation, and wording? You should identify all such problems you find. Such 
errors can be a serious problem when an author's native language is not English. 
It is not your job, however, to rewrite the paper. </p>
<p><b>What did you learn?</b> What did you, or what should the reader, learn 
from the paper? If you didn't learn anything, or if the intended reader won't 
learn anything, the paper is not publishable. </p>
<h2>Making recommendations </h2>
<p>After comparing the paper to an appropriate standard (not your own standards, 
which may be high or low), to the average of the papers that you write, or to 
the average of the papers that you find worth reading, you should be able to put 
it into one of these categories: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Major results; very significant (fewer than 1 percent of all papers). 
  </p>
  <p>(2) Good, solid, interesting work; a definite contribution (fewer than 10 
  percent). </p>
  <p>(3) Minor, but positive, contribution to knowledge (perhaps 10-30 percent). 
  </p>
  <p>(4) Elegant and technically correct but useless. This category includes 
  sophisticated analyses of flying pigs. </p>
  <p>(5) Neither elegant nor useful, but not actually wrong. </p>
  <p>(6) Wrong and misleading. </p>
  <p>(7) So badly written that technical evaluation is impossible. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The next question is: What are the standards of this journal or conference? 
Is this the <i>Proceedings of the IEEE</i>, <i>ACM Transactions on Computer 
Systems</i>, or the <i>ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles</i> (all 
quite selective), or is it the Tahiti Conference on Beach Ball and Computer 
Systems (fictional, but a presumed boondoggle)? You should compare the paper 
with the average paper in that specific journal or conference, not with the best 
or worst. Of course, in some cases the average is too low and needs to be raised 
by critical refereeing. Note that you cannot tell how selective a conference or 
journal is by the percentage of papers it accepts; far fewer bad papers are 
submitted to the best conferences and journals. </p>
<p>You should then make a recommendation, whether favorable ("publish") or 
unfavorable ("reject"). Your recommendation is your opinion as to whether the 
paper makes a sufficient contribution. Generally, this will include all papers 
in Categories 1 and 2 above and some in Category 3. The strength of your 
recommendation should be clear to the editor ("wonderful paper, definitely 
accept"; "useful paper, probably accept"; "marginal paper, see how many better 
ones have been submitted"; or "wrong and misleading, definitely reject"). If you 
feel that the paper has something worthwhile to say, but you're not sure it is 
good enough for this journal or conference, you can say "maybe." You can also 
recommend that a paper be rejected as inappropriate for the journal or 
conference. If the paper is inappropriate or marginal in quality for the forum 
but is suitable elsewhere, you can suggest other places to submit the paper. In 
any case, you must discuss and justify your recommendation. A recommendation 
without sufficient justification will carry very little weight. </p>
<p>If the author is asked to prepare a revised version, the revision will 
usually be sent to the same referees for further review. It is important to 
ensure that the revisions are satisfactory, but you should avoid comments 
inconsistent with your first review. You should also avoid harassing the author 
by unnecessarily recommending revision after revision. It is possible, however, 
that a revised manuscript still contains serious problems due to things 
overlooked in the first review, problems that have only become apparent after 
revision, or new errors introduced in the revision. Such problems must be 
addressed. The presence of serious problems after a second revision suggests 
that the author is incapable of fixing the problems, in which case it is often 
appropriate to recommend final rejection. </p>
<p>For a conference, a paper that requires substantial revision generally cannot 
be accepted due to the short time available for revisions and the difficulty of 
arranging for additional rounds of revisions. For journal publication, however, 
the extent of necessary revisions is a separate issue from the recommendation 
for (eventual) publication. </p>
<h2>Surveys and tutorials </h2>
<p>Surveys and tutorials differ from research papers in that most or all of the 
work reported is not new. Such a paper, however, might include a variety of 
minor research results that would not stand on their own in separate papers. 
</p>
<p>Surveys and tutorials are similar but not identical. A pure tutorial explains 
some body of material to nonexperts, usually novices. It might not cover the 
entire field, and it might have a specific point of view. A survey provides 
broad and thorough coverage of some field or body of knowledge. It can be aimed 
at readers ranging from the novice to the near-expert. </p>
<p>In reviewing a tutorial, there are specific issues to address: Does the paper 
cover the material promised by the title or abstract? Is this a reasonable body 
of knowledge to cover in a tutorial? Is the scope too wide, too narrow, or too 
bizarre to be useful? Does the paper have a consistent theme? Is the material 
correct? Is the level of coverage too simple-minded or sophisticated, given the 
likely audience? Is the paper well written and clear? This last is crucial for 
tutorials, but journals that publish tutorials, such as <i>Computer</i> and 
<i>ACM Computing Surveys</i>, often have editors and a professional staff to 
help with revisions.</p>
<p>For a survey, many of the same questions apply. Does the paper cover the 
material promised by the title or abstract, and is this a reasonable body of 
knowledge to survey at one time? Is the material correct, and is the author 
sufficiently expert on the subject to interpret results correctly and provide 
perspective on the field? Has the author integrated the material in a consistent 
manner, or is this just an annotated bibliography? Is the author's coverage 
balanced and thorough? Does he or she cite all important relevant literature, or 
is the presentation biased, slanted, or unevenly selective? Controversial 
opinions and evaluations should be identified as such. If the survey includes 
new research results, do they meet the validity and correctness criteria given 
above for research papers? (A survey does not have to stand on its own as a 
research paper, so the research does not have to be so significant as to justify 
publication as a research paper.) Finally, is the paper well written and clear? 
</p>
<h2>Proposals </h2>
<p>A proposal is a request to a funding agency, company, or foundation for 
financial support, supposedly to do the research described in the proposal. 
Reviewing proposals is quite different from reviewing papers, and some special 
considerations apply. Reviews of papers address only the science; reviews of 
proposals must also consider the investigator. </p>
<p>The primary difficulty with reviewing a proposal is that the investigator is 
supposed to tell you what he or she plans to do, in addition to what has been 
done already. The questions you must ask, then, are: Is the research topic 
significant? Is the method of approach described, and is it reasonable? Do the 
investigators and assistants appear to have sufficient expertise to produce 
useful results? Is the budget reasonable given the proposed research, the 
qualifications of the investigators, and the typical level of funding provided 
by the agency in question? Are the necessary facilities available? </p>
<p>The easiest way to write a detailed and specific proposal is to propose 
research that is already complete or at least substantially underway; this 
approach is quite common among established researchers. Unfortunately, that 
isn't the purpose of a research proposal, and requiring a high level of detail 
and specificity in the proposal discriminates against newcomers and those who 
propose new work. Also, a proposal might include a larger scope of work than can 
be reasonably accomplished with the time and effort specified. This is not a 
negative factor if the investigators clearly recognize it and indicate that they 
will choose subtopics, depending on their interest and the availability of 
assistants to work on them. </p>
<p>A major difference between a research proposal and a paper is that a proposal 
is speculative, so you must evaluate what is likely to result. Therefore, when 
you evaluate a proposal by a well-known investigator, a substantial fraction of 
that evaluation should depend on the investigator's reputation. People with a 
consistent history of good research will probably do good work, no matter how 
sloppy or brief their proposal. People with a consistent history of low-quality 
research will probably continue in the same manner, no matter how exciting the 
proposal, how voluminous their research, or how hot the topic. However, you must 
also consider the possibility that a well-regarded researcher may propose poor 
research or that a researcher noted for poor-quality work has decided to do 
better work.</p>
<p>It is important that you do not discriminate against newcomers who have no 
reputation, either good or bad. In this case, you must rely much more heavily on 
the text of the proposal and such information as the investigator's PhD 
institution and dissertation, academic record, host institution, and comments by 
his or her advisor or others.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to comment on the proposed budget. Keep in mind that many 
factors affect the size of the budget other than the proposed scope of research, 
such as the agency providing the funding and the availability of facilities and 
staff. Also note that for a new investigator, there is a major difference 
between no funding and minimal funding (two months summer salary plus amounts 
for travel, supplies, and computer time). Funding a new investigator at a low 
level is often a good gamble; two or three years later the investigator will 
have a track record and, if it is a good record, higher levels of funding can be 
justified. Such small grants are often called "initiation grants" and should be 
much easier to get than regular grants. </p>
<h2>Other issues </h2>
<p><b>Simultaneous submission, prior publication, and unrevised retries.</b> If 
an author submits a paper simultaneously to two or more places, he or she must 
have the approval of all editors or program chairs. </p>
<p>All referees should also be notified. Submitting a paper simultaneously 
without notification is unethical and a sufficient basis for rejection. There is 
a good chance that a simultaneous submission will be detected through the review 
process. </p>
<p>If a paper has already been published (in conference proceedings, for 
example) and is submitted for republication (perhaps in an archival journal), 
the editor and referees must be notified. Some associations such as the IEEE and 
ACM permit republication in their journals, but the paper generally must meet a 
higher standard than if it had never been published. Significant extensions or 
major revisions are often a sufficient reason for republication. As a reviewer, 
you should be alert to the author who tries to publish the same work in all its 
various combinations, permutations, and subsets, and to the author who adds the 
"least publishable unit" of new material to each paper. Also note that if the 
first version of the paper was published elsewhere, copyright restrictions might 
require the first publisher's explicit permission to republish the paper. </p>
<p>You will sometimes receive a paper to referee that you have previously 
recommended for rejection by some other publication. If the paper has not been 
rewritten to comply with your previous review, it is appropriate to return a 
copy of that review along with a blunt note suggesting that the author comply 
with referee reports. </p>
<p><b>Acknowledgments and plagiarism.</b> Authors must not plagiarize, and they 
must fully acknowledge joint work and the contributions of others. You should 
explicitly point out any such problems. </p>
<p><b>Timely response and retu</b></p></body></html>
